1. Consider the following program:


int main() {
	int a = ?;
	int b = ?;
	int c = ?;

	print(a is b+1);
	print(c is a+1);
	print(c is true);
	print(a is false);
}

Find values for a, b, and c that make this program print out four trues.


2. Mark if the following statements will always be true or not.

Example: "a is not b" is not always true because if a were true and b were false then the statement would be false.

If you need to, draw a table like the ones we did in 

a. "a is a"
b. "a and (b is b)"
c. "not (a is b)"
d. "((not a) or (not b)) is not (a and b)" 
e. "not (a or b) is ((not a) and (not b))"
